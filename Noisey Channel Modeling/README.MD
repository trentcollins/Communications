#Project Outline


The "Noisey Chanel Modeling.mlx" file models differents binary modulation schemes through a noisy filter. Addative White Gaussian Noise is used to model chanel noise. 
Modulations schemes include 8PSK, 4PAM, QPSK, and 16QAM. The system uses different filters including a matched filter, and sampling to interpret a message. A square root raised cosine carrier is used to send the message. Bit error rates are also compared for each implementation.
