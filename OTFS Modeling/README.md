# OTFS Modeling

This project implements joint radar sensing technology. The OTFS transform is implemented and tested for its range sensing, and communications abilities. First a pilot signal is sent and with it a chanell estimation is created. This chanel estimation is used to determine multipaths, their distances and their velocities. Additionally, the estimation is used to assist in sending a 4PSK message over a noisy chanel. The bit error rate is compared for different noises to determine the benefits and operation range of the model.


Code has been implemented with the help of the MATLAB forums.
